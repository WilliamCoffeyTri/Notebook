# My Notebooks

Quite often I find myself unable to grasp an idea by sheer word of mouth alone. It's easy enough to nod along and go "that makes sense", and to then forget that minimal amount of sensemaking one had performed not five minutes after the fact.

To avoid that end, I find it's best to not simply agree with ideas but to play with them. To verify, to explain, to demonstrate. These are the things that embed concepts in the mind. I make these notebooks for myself, and for my own education, but see no reason they shouldn't be public. If they can aid anyone else in understanding a concept then I should consider that a net good.
